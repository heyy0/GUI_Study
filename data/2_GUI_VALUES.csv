","I felt that the consciousness can really be brought about by the environment because there’s more oxygen here because of the trees and also the people we meet are really coming out from the heart, they are not here for competition but here to um settle down to be who they are, and this environment allow us to be who we are .

There’s a certain area corner in the farm that we actually follow the nature way of growing, like we use the leaves from the plants, the fallen leaves to actually put together in the vegetable bed. But the key thing is that we do not use fertilisers. We actually use the erm, food waste, the vegetable food waste and we use that as part of the, so called fertiliser.

First thing you notice is that there is no boundary between indoors and outdoors. There’s no separation between indoors and outdoors space and, we talk about co-existence with nature, elements of nature all around. You can see the squirrels scurrying in the space all the time. You can see the monitor lizards come into our workshop.

There’s no separation between nature and man-made spaces. And we’re also trying to find harmony and co-exist in with these other members, is not human members in our community

","She felt that because there’s this environment there’s a possibility that there’s this certain energy, you know for the law of attraction there’s a possibility that we are gathering or attracting this similar concept or similar values people to be present here. I’m one of them

I’ve seen a lot of examples where when they go back they actually regularly bring their children back and also some bring their parents along, so like grandparents themselves and then grandchildren","When we’re washing the dishes everyone comes together to do your own dishes, or together. Even for our chief, kampung chief laihock he also come together to do the washing

there’s more of a horizontal structure, everyone comes here has a place and then they contribute as much as they want… so.. no expectations on anyone

in the farming environment we actually have lots of work to do and it’s actually very vigorous so, um, very often we work together as a group and it’s not really like a top down kind of working situation. Yeah. so from there if we have noticed that this particular person keep on coming back on a daily basis then we will give that person an opportunity and we really want to keep that person. So um we give them some leadership work that he/she can have for some opportunity to play.

We don’t actually dictate how they should run it. So they’re working the ground and they are adjusting based on what they observe. We have the flexibility to do","it’s all right to make mistakes. Because it’s only through mistakes that we learn something. So I find even though it’s only four days, but I felt through conversations with people erm. I feel safe yeah. It’s ok to make mistakes! Ah that is a wonderful feeling that I get.

I think there’s this element of trust give people power to try things you have to trust them first. I think that is what’s been assured through the process. It also takes a lot of courage ? and trust that they are not used to

I’m also in transition, and I’ve felt that the, it’s safe to come  back here and yeah. Not only coming back to nature but like coming back to a family.

It’s a combination of factors so it’s creating a safe space … nobody is here to prove a point, or always here to compete.

So two thousand three they actually created this community and this community came out with, uh, so called certain values. And two of them Laihock actually mentioned, that is important, which is risk taking and creativity

So he’ll want this culture here where we are really hands on ourselves, get cut, but the risk taking portion is there, um, our opportunity for them to go into that part and also er, creativity, that’s where ? comes in","I think it was a single mother with a kid. The kid was quite introvert? Then suddenly. the mum is always bringing ? volunteers, helping out the… so they I think even independent on his own so…. Mom you don’t need to ?

So we try to include people in the decision making process.

actually have to have the environment… and makes it possible for people to actually participate in this kind of collaboration. So that has to be a system ?

in the farming environment we actually have lots of work to do and it’s actually very vigorous so, um, very often we work together as a group and it’s not really like a top down kind of working situation. Yeah. so from there if we have noticed that this particular person keep on coming back on a daily basis then we will give that person an opportunity and we really want to keep that person. So um we give them some leadership work that he/she can have for some opportunity to play.

And we also welcome people who initiate that the volunteer service. Yeah because we have a huge piece of land and there’s different plots so those who are regular we actually um suggest or um allocate a plot of land for that particular person to be in charge of.

she’s maybe a landscape architect or something, graphic design, something like that. So landscaping wise, as it’s all through observation, so we will continue to observe, for this case she has observed this particular person, so she has given this particular person to be in charge of landscaping, yeah. It’s a mister, and because of his age, and he’s a retiree, so um, doing the hard work could be quite a tiring for the person, so um, and sometimes she would allocate a few volunteer to help him to do the landscaping. So he is fully in charge of the landscaping part of it.

It’s really giving space for people to um do what he or she loves, and um enjoy doing , and it will really bring different type of beauty to the environment. And not forced because it’s somebody’s work.

Partly because of the nature of the land cause it’s quite big and because of the different tasks they have on the ground itself, the farming area. So um and also partly to give the person on the job some job satisfaction so um, there is a certain leadership quality that she would observe and she would also observe people of the similar um chemistry and they’ll put them together to do the work.

So in terms of volunteers we’re actually now .. before we are including more and more the volunteers in the planning and execution of programs, running of programs, so now we’re actually have a programs at woody space that are run exclusively by volunteers.. We don’t actually dictate how they should run it. So they’re working the ground and they are adjusting based on what they observe. We have the flexibility to do","
","The way we relate to things affect the way we relate to people. because of the way society is structured, very self interested, so we don’t care about people all that much. Just like the way we don’t care about nature or the stuff we use. So I think there’s a missing link there that GUI’s  programs help to re-establish, or attempts to re-establish.

the values that we actually erm, so called propagate, is human values. Is in every one of them. It’s a matter of whether the environment actually have that already at home or in their workplace .. so everyone has it. It’s just that moment where there’s opportunity for me to share with someone

So this environment does attract people of certain types. And that’s okay, there are difficulties in actually changing mindsets of people who do not share the values i think that is the difficult part.

It’s a combination of factors so it’s creating a safe space … nobody is here to prove a point, or always here to compete.

this is a place where everyone can gather together and they can reach out to a bigger community with their ideas and thoughts and values. Yeah so this is needed.

the main purpose of uh, Ground up initiative is to bring humanity back to Singapore.

So if we can create a space where everyone can come back and also get that inner peace, erm, strengthened, then when they go out, they will be another GUI

So we are like a cushion, we want to become that cushion, that Singapore government can rest on. Because as a people in the erm government sector or in the ministry, they would also feel safe that the Singaporeans have a place where they can come and think who they are, what they want to do. So um, i see that as what GUI is.

but we need to be strong enough to gather people who have the same mindset, so they see that we’re this little light, and this flame is growing, and we will get the attention

i hope that GUI can continue to have this self, private, um, identity. So we won’t get involved with the government telling us what to do because it seems to me that there are a number of small organisations or non profit organisations they have the government involvement into it and the direction change. I hope that the government can hear um, from more voices, more perspective

I really hope that GUI can become a platform where um the government can experience? Different types of people voicing out and take us seriously"
2 : 2_GUI_FGD_2_Core_2,"we promote collaborative activism

We don't need to fight against the authority. Yeah. Erm, but to share to you what is this, what is your perspective, then try to understand from the other people's perspective and explore, ways out together.

we are definitely a symbol of alternative conversation happening in Singapore. We want to bring social change

And there are many examples over the years we have activated the community to reach out to other things, like when Mr. Lee Kwan Yew passed away, in four days we rallied sixteen volunteers to do a memorial service at Yishun

We facilitated twenty thousand over residents to do that

We don't have to ask people to be, eh you must love the environment. Right or not. Eh you must talk to this person. Just by doing it. Yeah. Show them that it's possible. 

I think, we are a very strong activist. If not we easily give up, it's a very tough journey for every single one that is sitting in this, in this, in this room. And we stay on because it's, it's a belief that we are fighting so hard. But in a very gentle way. Because this energy, this belief has to be felt. It cannot be by just looking. It will not sustain. So what we are doing, we are activists, actually. In my own understanding

We want people to be influenced by the act. They see us, they hear us, they observe us, they think that it's something that they can agreed, they want to be change as well, then, collaborate in certain sense, certain way. So that is if you turn back as a collaborative, activist. It's a gentle but powerful way.","Our space is more, rugged. It's more, free-formed. And we don't stop people from changing the environment that.

we have a very beautiful stream that cuts through the entire space

Very near to urban yet at the same time it's semi-natural. Yeah. So people can be in the natural space yet know that they are a step away from their comfort zone

our late founder late Chief said that you know our space cannot be the extreme. that means we cannot be uh like in many places where they have eco-village which has no air-con, no, perhaps no running water, um, but GUI can be that balance where urbanites can connect, come here, be comfortable, and yet be exposed at the same time

But why do we feel different when we are at these two places. I don't know. Maybe it's the wilderness that we're talking about. Maybe it's the rusticness that we let things grow sometimes really out of hand

To some it looks like, so messy and then, you know, and no one is doing about it. but, it's that sense of relax, that's in the air. Then I want to see, I want to say, ok maybe the place is very quiet and, but this kind of quietness is also very different

we encourage people to pluck and taste and smell, yeah, because it's safe for them to do so

The free spirit.

over here we have, everybody, any animals that can, can be come here. We don't like, throw them off, everything, so, yeah, so, it's become a very big, like, very big uh, ecosystem for us and for them also, so we like, planting together, so, this gives us a different feeling la, compared to other places in Singapore

But here we just leave it here. So sometimes we'll see monkeys going around, then, then it's very fun, yeah. We're staying together with them, and yeah this gives a different feeling i think.

i think the, the imperfection is, brings the perfection

So, the feeling of there's always something to be done.

or every plant every tree, yeah nothing from outside. For the streams, the ponds, nothing different from outside

So people come here to experience unperfection. Because nature is just like that. So people come here, it looks close to nature, because they are wild.","I think the seniors actually benefited, uh by having a common activity that they can do together with other family members.

it’s good in bonding with their family member and getting them out to do something er, which they are comfortable with.

the problem that we are tackling is social isolation

we host activities like that. We have a, we help to promote their wellbeing on the overall, when they are engaged in the activity, and with the people around them in their neighborhood

To us, I don't think we have the skill to change people. However, we are like a flat that will attract people with the similar mindset to come together. So we can't change the bigger community but we are able to gather people with the same, similar mindset to come together. Oh, GUI, yeah, yeah, there's this place. So then, um, collective urm, then we can create change

I don't think I'm, we are able to change them, but I can attract people who are similar mindset to come.","
","probably the first thing that you will feel is that people here is extremely friendly and you are not afraid to say hi.

i think, in certain way it really builds up my confidence. Erm. Erm. How should I say it? Sociable in a way, be able to talk to other people because I find this really very, safe space.

Everybody is so friendly. That’s how and why I stay. 

I think it just means, even if you’re not hundred percent ready, people will be given the opportunity to be on that, in that role

empowerment in GUI's definition ? means that you're just given the opportunity to try even though you know there'll be mistakes. ah and it's ok. yeah but of course it has to be calculated la

we follow up and make sure the person is taken care of. ah, emotionally also. like maybe there were some mistakes made and then they feel they have to talk about it. so it's like giving space to feel confidence.

Because here is, everybody's so friendly. It's just like friends. There's no competition, there's no competitive. So it can be a at your own pace.

You're here, you feel like home. You're safe. Even if the program is cancelled you can still do other stuff. Just like home.","we encourage them, after going through the uh, four session program, to continue to become a volunteer.

the youth coming back again and taking up leadership role. Yeah. To help facilitate programs, run programs. 

we just give them that opportunity to, to do things. I think what we are trying to cultivate is that sense of ownership here. We believe that only when you own it, you will get to stay. And we want people to stay and go

But if the person is willing, he or she would be given that choice to just try lor. Then you make mistakes and then you try again. So i think sense of ownership comes from there

we still hand-hold awhile, a little bit, so that they are, we want them to feel assured that, you know, we're there. but we're not like cover everything for you, you just need to be, try to swim as well

My farm educators. I only train them once and then i train them to lead. Lead tour. 

I may just observe and then make pointers, you give feedback. yeah. all of us go through that. during our time here. 

I think that, that gives a sense of erm, maybe freedom, like what she mentioned.

The free spirit.

people can contribute, to make it better.

because you are free to do things, yeah. Hands-on and everything then, like for example in other parks, you'll just see. And over here, we don't encourage people to only see. We encourage people to, to, and they just be free, be themselves,

But i think over here is really build up by the people, so you have that kind of, you can feel, feel is different because it's really hand-built by everybody here

So, like, if let's say everything is done, so perfectly, you'll feel that oh it's completed. So that down here there's this, you feel that there's like, okay ongoing and ongoing and going 

Continuity

The programme here is not very transactional. Yeah. It's, there's a lot of, a lot more openness","i feel sense of ownership is linked to sense of place. and on more than one occasion i've had young people tell me, if GUI is gone, they have one less reason to stay in Singapore.

You feel the sense of liveliness, and the energy, which you don't, probably don't get it outside.

because we are here ten years, so when you see things differently also

i think that, that gives a sense of erm, maybe freedom, like what she mentioned.

people can contribute, to make it better.

Then they were proud, wah then they said, wah this is really very different. To them very rewarding.

you can feel, feel is different because it's really hand-built by everybody here

maybe that imperfection, so things like er, the fence that we build, the Ben lead us and everybody be part of it, painting it and installing it in a way that they feel is good

i think the, the imperfection is, brings the perfection

there is no sense of urgency when you are here


i feel sense of ownership is linked to sense of place. and on more than one occasion i've had young people tell me, if GUI is gone, they have one less reason to stay in Singapore.

there is no sense of urgency when you are here
","I think this place create a, uh, something for people to experience.

i think over here it provide the environment as well as the support for them to try new ideas as well as uh, tapping on the ecosystem

Is the entire ecosystem that give you that, and you are the one that's going to figure this out ??? situation. That's ?? part of this space, people. The combination has to be this. 

So, I don't think we are trying to change a culture where okay, you pursue this then you have to forgo this. No. Why can't you have both? And both can comes in different time, you are just growing, growing

we want everybody first of all to be happy at where they are. Or where they are not. Just to be happy. And must be grateful. We want this to be a very happy nation, everybody just, shouldn't have too much anger at things, unless you know what to do about it, then yes, by all means

Erm, to we I don't think we have the skill to change people. However, we are like a flat that will attract people with the similar mindset to come together. So we can't change the bigger community but we are able to gather people with the same, similar mindset to come together. Oh, GUI, yeah, yeah, there's this place. So then, um, collective, then we can create change

This group is not about money, we have a different values system. Alright. Uh, then so it's like, this retaining 1:34:25 this, now we could be just a small dot. Alright. Hopefully we can attract enough alright, to, to increase, the impact.

So that's why GUI cannot be forever social, that is still our base, we have to balance with the business. So there is actually a little shift in how we are doing things right now

But I think we, we have the ability to create environment. Yeah. And I think it's the environment that will change people

But it's the environment that we created, to get them to, to really make their own toy, erm. It's not whether how good you have made it, alright. But the process that how much effort you have put in to make it.

if whatever we do here is successful, I can very freely let my daughter run, take a bus home herself. Yeah, no worry, a people place to bring up children
"
3 : 3_GUI_FGD_Young_26_below_Vols_12_Oct,"I became more of like an advocate.

I gather more knowledge and I realize that eh, I can step up and do a little bit more. Start to share with people what I know, why are we doing what we are doing, and how can I, within my means and within my circle, whoever that I interact with, share with them these small little nuggets of information, hopefully they become aware that there’s such thing being practised

Even though I know 1 voice is not going to do much, but it’s just so important to participate and to show that you believe in this political process of consultative decision making. I don’t just opt out because I believe that my voice won’t matter, but I participate, I tell people that I’ve participated. I think it helps to bridge the government-citizens trust, which is so fraught nowadays, so power of community

I think that over here, this thing about empowerment is, everyone, regardless of who you are, no matter how small your role is, has a part to play.","It gives you the pseudo feeling that you’re not in Singapore. Coming to GUI is sort of like a risk in itself for me

Whereas over here, maybe because we are on the ground, we are free to grow whatever that is suitable to be grown here. There’s more room to explore what can be grown, so I would say over here, boundaries are different from the ones outside","I’m actually quite introverted, so it’s a very comfortable place to talk to people, connect to the community.

My own interest is I really, genuinely could feel that they would love to interact with people, and somehow, I’m inspired to do likewise and take that up over time, and become more experienced.

I think it’s also more of the culture, how they really .. you know how GUI really values the human interactions, human relations and they like Hui Ying, our core team member, checks up on me

think that the core team, and how they emanate their positivity and the way that they model how to be generally just positive and good human beings is like, very important.

speaking about connection and interaction, interaction with people is not just talking. You don’t have to talk to interact.

We just spoke for a little while, and then there was silence all the way. But it feels very comfortable, the interaction was very therapeutic.

I think it goes as to the same, as to how human interaction and communities are formed. Again, it’s always very randomized. You don’t force things, whatever that’s happening around. That’s the biggest contradiction.","I think being in a place like GUI, that empowerment comes from people who humanizes you in a dehumanized world. As long as we are a group of people who realize that we are on the ground, we are flat, we treat each other with respect and dignity, as autonomous individuals. This is the empowerment that this place gives","It also helps me step out of my comfort zone, because I started out farming and craft, and then I moved on to helping the other programs ? I would never imagine myself teaching children at all, I will not sacrifice children’s lives at my hand

I feel that they genuinely welcome me and then somehow, over time by, myself also acquire that positive and negative and that.. I don’t know, that just becomes so infectious.

Slowly, Hui Ying will also be like, “ok you seem like you can do social media stuff” or “you have this talent, do you want to do more?” Yeah, I think she has done that a few times already. She’s quite good at picking up what people are good at.

With more involvement, on top of your regular work or regular school, I just slowly over time became more involved. Now I’m doing the social media stuff, Humans of GUI, Balik Kampung, farm tours. That also brings me to work closer with my other volunteers, it just keeps going forward.

I’m usually like, ok you do and I just follow. Whatever you need to do, you can ask me, saikang, I’ll do the dirty work for you. But I actually had to play a part in planning, it was a different take. It was the same event, but now I’m on a different side of it, the organizing side of it, a leadership kind of role in a sense. Previously, I think of inwards, myself, but now I think outwards.

all my leadership opportunities come with GUI

I learnt that it’s okay to fail. I think there’s a bunch of responsibilities that are recently put on me, because I think Hui Ying really needs help. I think with that, comes the stresses as always because first time doing something, it’s always like that stress. I don’t want to stress about this because it’s GUI. I don’t want to stress about this thing that GUI makes me do. If I fail to mention something at the start of Balik Kampung, or at the start of my kampung tour then so be it. Just fail in knowledge and learn. The learning mindset also. Just treating every week is learning

This place is freaking amazing and it makes me believe that “yeah, I could do something too” in my own life to make a meaningful contribution to society, in 1 way or another.

I go find my own fruit trees. I feel that there are certain fruit trees, or the grounds behind GUI that’s very uneven so sometimes some fruits have to be harvested like mangosteens

But somehow this place just encourages me to give it a try. You won’t know what would happen right? So I just try and things just happen. Now I can manually saw things, do things, fix certain things on my own.

It gives you the pseudo feeling that you’re not in Singapore. Coming to GUI is sort of like a risk in itself for me

First, engage them in conversation, then get to know them, then try to make them feel comfortable in this space, then try to make them come back, please come back! So having to think about that, it was outside my comfort zone.

coming to GUI and staying in GUI is a risk in itself for my well-being. For my perceived well-being. It probably helped me in my actual well-being

Previously I was like, if something was risky, I’ll be thinking should I take this risk, but now I’m thinking, should I take this leap of faith? So it’s kind of changed, a little bit like. my whole life has been quite smooth sailing, I went to good schools, so my path was very clear. If I followed my peers, there’s no way I can land badly in future. So I’m just, I’m more daring to steer from the usual path, do my own thing

But I think the ecosystem and the interdependency we have her made me realize that we need to see through what these risks are all about in the first place. What’s the actionable goal, while exploring the boundaries

I don’t like commitments, so I was like, try once first before trying to commit to coming here more regularly. That was a risk. Afterwards, it was also Hui Ying who asked me to try new things. Now from time to time I will participate in kampung tour, that kind of thing.","I’m inspired to do likewise and take that up over time, and become more experienced.

all my leadership opportunities come with GUI

I’m thinking of starting something next semester and even this semester, for my projects, I keep pushing for topics related to sustainability. I think being here allowed me to do that.

This place is freaking amazing and it makes me believe that “yeah, I could do something too” in my own life to make a meaningful contribution to society, in 1 way or another.

Even if it’s on a very small scale, I believe it’s to do things that I want to see in societies of the future. Like how do you want to build future resilience, climate resilience in societies, I think this is what we need. A farm. Woodworking space. Just the human connection.

I think that over here, this thing about empowerment is, everyone, regardless of who you are, no matter how small your role is, has a part to play.

You make the decision to do something to improve this small. As small as this, you don’t have to be the decision maker but yeah, helps to keep the space going. Know the bigger picture, but every small individual act contributes to this whole thing, this whole cause that we are doing.

I go find my own fruit trees. I feel that there are certain fruit trees, or the grounds behind GUI that’s very uneven so sometimes some fruits have to be harvested like mangosteens

I try to give the new volunteers the same experience that I got when I came over because I feel that’s only right. I got that experience.

But I think the ecosystem and the interdependency we have her made me realize that we need to see through what these risks are all about in the first place. What’s the actionable goal, while exploring the boundaries

What GUI does is that it gives a lot of ownership and empowerment to people to take their place and say that “oh I want to take care of this area” and that’s why we have active volunteers.

they bring with them knowledge like they’re architects, or whatever, retired already, they help to shape up this entire landscape base with their own idea. Because they’re tasked to take care of the space. They don’t have anybody to report to, because trust has been placed on them to take charge of that space
","
","I’d just like to add on. I think generally what keeps volunteers here is because we are not expected to be out of who we really are here. We are not expected to be able to fulfil certain things

I realized how important this space is for so many people in Singapore. Because we do not have this kind of community bonding that happens so organically, that’s not forced. It’s not something that our government does, that socially engineers people into different races, in different HDBs"
4 : 4_GUI_FGD_Vols_26_above,"People here don’t judge you but you would try to bring that back because you are so filled with it. The experience it fills you to the brim and overflowing. And you would want to bring it back and start doing it. And by you doing it, you’re actually spreading that ripples.

Because people here really walk the talk.

So here, they really walk the talk. And that makes the difference, because people observe. They don’t dismiss it, they see what they do. Ok, but are you for real? So here, it’s really for real. I think to me, that is a lot of difference.

But here, you come here you really walk the talk. Whatever values that you learned in school, but here you automatically would do it. Because somehow the space invites you to do it. And because people are really doing it. You just feel like, yeah it’s natural. Not because someone asked me to do it. It’s just natural, everybody just walk the talk.
","Real nature is like GUI. It looks messy but that’s how, you see, the weed, you know the weed has its own function if you really study it. Even the weed is there for a purpose. Little creepy crawlies are there for a purpose, even the leaves that dropped are there for a purpose.

Here, when you see all the weeds and stuff there, there are happy bees. Not that stressed ones that you see from farms to farms to pollinate. That’s the natural thing and that’s where you teach, like what she was saying, even the weeds have a purpose, right?

So the space, indirectly tells you whether is it open and inviting and non-judgemental, you can be truly yourself.

I think that’s the key here. I think to take a step back, it’s really about the environment. Laihock was very big on keeping this space, it’s because this space does make a difference on people. In the ancient Chinese saying, a person who’s wise, they would live near the mountains, because it gives them that perspective, that space.

There is an intention in the place.

There are some changes that you can observe the changes. I guess that is one thing that is different.","This is a place where I get to say ‘hi’ to people, and people wave back. Or initiate a wave

they always took time to engage with people that were there. Whether they were volunteers, or participants in some activities there. And always took time to put work aside and just sit down, have tea sessions at

So I would think that by and large, if we’re talking about how we can actually form relationships with people, I think its a no-brainer, people have to be friendly, welcoming and accommodating. But you must find something there that you can relate to and for the

when you have that space, you will attract people with similar frequency, I would put it this way. Like-minded people will come. Even birds, they will perch together.

Then this place inevitably will attract people who are warm, who are non-judgemental, who are open, and of course they are friendly people. And then you have people who are different ages

I think for the first time, it’s that this place is very welcoming. So I think you can already feeling… It’s very hard to put into words, I guess. And then as you come back more, it just build on each other and… it’s not so much about volunteering, how I can contribute

It’s very different from here where people just welcome you to smell it, touch it, and even pluck the top. They’ll teach you how to pluck so you won’t injure the plant. It’s very different.","And there are a lot of different people that we meet here. It’s all inclusive. SO I can learn a lot. So that’s the empowering part, to see that there’s so much out there fore you to explore.

Whereas here people are told to volunteer, to share their passion. They have Woodspace, purely run by volunteers, and you can feel and be infected. By their passion, they are truly from their own freewill, their passion. That you don’t feel it elsewhere, so it’s very different","So my motivation is really, first as a mother, I was looking for a space like this. Where the children can be grounded, can feel the earth, can touch, explore, and not being penalised or fined. At least they can be comfortable to ask questions, even though how silly it is, and to really explore with their senses.

I’m very comfortable with inviting new people in here. Like anybody. I don’t have to set any expectations. I know even if they get lost here, they will find something. So that’s the... To me you’re truly free when you have a home to come back to

So the space, indirectly tells you whether is it open and inviting and non-judgemental, you can be truly yourself.

And to the extent of healing it because this space is so inclusive, so embracing. There’s really no judgement, no right or wrong.

There’s no right or wrong, good or bad. Because everything here has its role. And it’s non-judgemental, it’s very embracing and inclusive. Whether you’re old or young, you’ll always have a part to play. And that is very healing in the sense that in an outside role","First we do the Balik Kampung, we do the farm. And subsequently I actually organised a holiday camp, school camp. Not school, but holiday camp during the school break where we bring children through various guided and unstructured activity, where they can experience something that is very much kampung like.

But for a lot of the activities that I see over here, people just really contribute to the growth of the farming plots over here

I think this whole space is very special in that, it’s very inclusive, is the word to use. In that, it doesn’t matter how old you are, it doesn’t matter what you can do, we always believe that there’s something you can contribute

But the fact is that the stuff that you do here, you feel the connection because you have left your mark. And in the world there is all these curation, it’s very hard to leave your mark, and people want to be noticed

Yeah, I contributed to something, and that it sustained the place. The volunteers are the lifeblood of this place. It wouldn’t carry if there are no volunteers supporting it.

the first question he asked was, so how can you contribute? You can start a project, do something that you want to do. So it’s very inviting. So we were like 6 years old, 3 years old, what can you do? As a mother, I was like, they’d do more destruction than good. But he actually had this vision that even young kids can contribute

It’s really their freewill. Yes, autonomy. They are truly empowered. It’s not like top-down direction. It’s really from their own freewill. I don’t feel like doing the dishes today, I don’t feel like helping out at the kitchen, I will do farming, I will do the… whatever. Or I feel like doing woodwork today, then I will go to the woodwork section and help. So they have choices, they have autonomy. They are able to engage based on their own freewill to choose what chores or what activity they want to do.

Whereas over here it’s really your choice. I think that’s really empowerment. What is it that you want to do, what is it that you want to contribute today. There a lot of things that you can explore and try. I think, you may not be very good at certain things, but then they still embrace, let you go and try and just make the best out of things. Or like try to work together to try and get the things to the standard that is needed

But for children, being able to, to their point, to just do whatever they want and have that freedom to explore, it leaves a very powerful mark on the them, to the fact that they actually want to contribute something to this space that gave them this room to express themselves

as children, what they experienced as teens will actually go on to shape their lives in very deep ways

Whereas here people are told to volunteer, to share their passion. They have Woodspace, purely run by volunteers, and you can feel and be infected. By their passion, they are truly from their own freewill, their passion. That you don’t feel it elsewhere, so it’s very different

What was very surprising to me when I was there, was how everybody when they stood up, they just...nobody needed to say anything, they just arranged all the chairs nicely and put them at the back. Without have to be prompted at all.

Since you can be yourself here, the space is here for you to express

They are not business-driven. They’re not profit driven. They are purely here out of their own free will to help. And they don’t ask for anything in return.

There’s no right or wrong, good or bad. Because everything here has its role. And it’s non-judgemental, it’s very embracing and inclusive. Whether you’re old or young, you’ll always have a part to play. And that is very healing in the sense that in an outside role

over here when we do things, and this is something that we have said across throughout this conversation, is that when we give, we don’t really expect anything in return. We do it because we actually want to contribute to the growth of this space. And that growth itself is the reward that we want, and being able to serve the people, that itself is good enough for us

I think it’s also building the intrinsic motivation to do something. So like how we’ve been saying freewill all that quite a lot but I think it’s really coming from the heart.

So trust, and intrinsic motivation is the next one I guess. It’s really something inside that drives you to do whatever that you’re doing and I think the people here, they really demonstrate that as well. And I think that alone gives you a lot of courage and a lot of power to do things
","But the fact is that the stuff that you do here, you feel the connection because you have left your mark.

I think that’s the key here. I think to take a step back, it’s really about the environment. Laihock was very big on keeping this space, it’s because this space does make a difference on people. In the ancient Chinese saying, a person who’s wise, they would live near the mountains, because it gives them that perspective, that space.

So when you’re in a space where it gives you a different perspective alive with things

","Yes, it’s not just we use to the technicalities of the activities itself. There’s many more deep secret layers to it. I cannot really verbalise it right now but it is not just about the activity itself. Because if it’s just the activity itself, you can take the same activity and do it elsewhere and the results will be the same

So things still have to be done in the right way, but the overall intention - that's the deciding factor to stop it from being too curated. Overall intention for you to be able to leave your mark, walk through these struggles to connect from one place to another."
5 : 5_GUI_FGD_Vols_26_above,"But the first thing they really tell you is, oh yeah just let us know. Instead of telling us if you have this set of boxes you can check, then you can come here and do something

also through the gatherings, that’s how ideas are born. I like sketching, I’m sketching here today. And then suddenly another guy comes over and say, eh why not we have an event and everyone sketch together? How should we organise it? And everyone chimed in, ok let’s do this, do that. So that’s usually how things are started here. Very organic.

Yeah, so I try to influence them by example but I think it’s because my constant exposure to this organisation, reminds me and keeps me in touch of awareness of sustainability. So I’m still doing it. So I hope more people can get exposed to this kind of thinking so that we can make a bigger difference.

I think it’s something about being part of your life that, because you’re physically here, you experience it, you touch it, you feel it, so the impression that you have to do something about it is deeper than just watching a video.

The kind of people that you meet here can be really inspiring. Like how they actually act on what they believe in. It’s not just talk. And it takes a lot of guts to build this place up.","So it would prompt people to take care of it, because it’s precious, it’s not done by workers contracted by the government to do it. So you have to, like, okay this is our land, it’s not so tiny but we do it ourselves to maintain it.

I think you’ll never know what’s going to happen here sometimes. I come here once a month, every time I come here something is different. There’s a new plant coming, there’s a new fruit, this tree is blossoming. The next time I come it’s flowering

First of all, this place is not a park. It’s a kampung. So they stick to, closely to the principle of being a kampung. Lots of trees, small farms here and there.

Because we are not competing with Botanic Garden, neither are we trying to out compete macritchie reservoir. We’re not trying to do that, we’re not trying to have a rainforest here, no. This is a kampung, so everything should have a function. Trees? Fruit trees. What you grow, it’s meant for consumption or could be for medicinal purposes.

Because they are not paying anyone to cut, so it’s really, this place can be as beautiful as it can be depending on the community itself. So at least that’s a difference between this place and our public parks

Doesn’t feel like Singapore. I mean not so much because it’s a kampung place. Because we have more like kampung in Malaysia you can easily visit.

it’s a kampung campus. It’s a school inspired by nature. So i think in that aspect this place has done pretty well. It fused nature with all the activities, and of course, the software, the people.

So it’s like a physical manifestation of all these concepts that we are talking about, all these circular economy. Those materials that goes into what we produce.

","I think it’s like these breaks that allows you to come together and, you know, talk among the volunteers that kind of also helps to build up the so-called, community spirit over time. So I would say it’s like a one or two time thing. But if you happen to be here for a few times and if you are a part of this little bonding sessions, then I think it does help build up that community spirit thing.

okay. I decided to actually start talking to them and say Hi. And since then we have been talking and saying Hi, asking about their kids and stuff. So i think that’s like a big step for me also to do the initiation now. Now I can say I know everyone on the floor!

I think it’s the type of interactions I guess, and nobody asked for money.

Where you try to connect with people more, we try to be more grounded, and that’s very deep.

That nature, or whatever this organisation is doing, is helping the young people to come together, and you can find that they are a lot more relaxed and then they feel connected to one another.",this is a good place to complement what we already have. Something that’s a little bit less structured and more exploration.,"It’s a kind of place where it really is a community and the sense that it welcomes… it's a place that welcomes people. That's all that it needs to be. Let's use the analogy of a church maybe. You just come as you are. It is not a religion. You don't need to be anything. Just come and be part of it. That's all.

there is a culture in the community here. You look at anyone that passed by, you’d say good morning to them with a smile. And that’s very different from any other types of community that you can see outside of this small group. So it makes people feel immediately included, that oh I can be part of this group anytime I want to come.

I feel like maybe it’s because people come here without any motive like I want to sell you something. So people feel safe to be with each other

I think the people here are very open to hearing ideas from you. So let’s say like, for example the Kampung Sketching thing. Or if there’s anything at all that you want to come to this place and do, they are actually very open to hearing out ideas

They have lots of trust in us, giving us free play to do, to try out. Extremely encouraging. So I think it’s the people.

perhaps like, you come here just to be yourself. And not to have like a, you don’t need to perform, or contribute something

So I really like the fluidity and everyone being very open and there’s not like a performance, there’s no grading, you’re not expected to… Yeah, that’s why I say it’s a good mental break.

it’s ok to fail, I feel. Because when we started kampung sketching, I really wasn’t sure how it was going to turn out. Whether people would even come but I just did it anyway because even though I was stressed, but nobody even cares. Even if there’s even one person or nobody turns up, I’m still going to do this. Cos I don’t feel expectations that it has to meet a certain quota or anything.

this is a place where you can do all of that without feeling the pressure of… yes, safe space

when you’re a working adult you always have to do well on your career and all that, but places whereby you can try things and not do well and it’s still ok, is kind of rare.

But then when we are facilitating, I just tell them that I never do, but i’m willing to figure it out with you. So you know just try.

here the people are so understanding, you’ll sure find like out of 10, 5 will like it, the other 5 not like it, but it’s okay.

It’s a much slower pace and low expectations. Don’t have to prove anything when you’re here.

kind of trained up my confidence as well to be a leader, in some ways. Pushing me out of my comfort zone to do things that I normally wouldn’t volunteer to do.

I always have the perception, they are boys, you know, they’ll just be ruining things, messing things. But I guess after that session I feel more confidence that actually boys can do it. So we go one more session very near my hands, and that is how I feel.

You feel like it’s okay here. And you want to do it, it means something to you. And people are likeminded enough there.

being allowed to fail here without being the pressure of being judged and to pay for it.","And I’m also pretty active in doing this urban sketching in the community. So I got ideas of why not I do something similar, bringing sketching here in GUI. I feel like I want to contribute in a way that aligns with my strengths and something different from what they’re doing here so we can get a different group of people to visit GUI. So somehow through a talk, I started this Kampung Sketching earlier this May.

I think that everybody there is here today, is not here for money. They are here because they want to be here.

But the first thing they really tell you is, oh yeah just let us know. Instead of telling us if you have this set of boxes you can check, then you can come here and do something

So that’s usually how things are started here. Very organic.

Here, the only boundary is yourself. And if you can have the faith or the courage, or whatever you called it, to do something weird, we'll figure it out. Maybe we don't have the resources to do it together but if it’s something reasonable, do it and see what happens.

Yeah, it’s a sense of belonging. And because you invested your time and energy into helping maintaining this space. So you feel in a sense you own a little bit of this

Because here if you see something, you would just be doing it. Like you won’t ask somebody to help you or you won’t complain to anyone. If you see something that needs to be done, you would do it

you’re actually here for the purpose of contributing to something else other than yourself, this makes you feel happier, lighter, less pressure, more relaxed, and that’s what they say, healing the soul is.

now that his parents are retired, he thought that they might like it here, so he brought them here. I think they liked it here, because it’s a place for them to do things, get occupied. Just like the good old days.","It’s a kind of place where it really is a community and the sense that it welcomes… it's a place that welcomes people. That's all that it needs to be.

6 : 6_GUI_FGD_Vols_26_below,"If i were to relate what we do here to the other environment, it would be that we can show the world that we can be sustainable by doing things like going plant-based, being conscious of my environment etc etc. And I am able to influence my friends to have better habits.

Here, once people gets the opportunity you can see a different side of them, where they can be more confident, more outspoken and this only comes when they get the opportunity to lead","
","I realised that it’s not what its all about, that its important to connect with other people. I started to interact with more people, to hear and learn from their experiences. I think I lived a sheltered life but hearing their experiences give me a window to look into society, make me grow as a person. Learning from them makes me a more sympathetic person and opened up my ears to want to listen more and learn and grow from their experiences

It also made me realise the importance of connecting with other people. After coming here I realise I’m more open to things.

For example Hui Ying, I felt very inspired on how she was able to talk to me, lead me around and make me feel comfortable, and I hope to be able to learn to communicate and accommodating to others like she doe","
","GUI helps us to learn soft skills, and lets us grow at our own pace without being afraid of growth.

I was reading about how this place started. It was when they wanted people to be more creative and risk taking.

Here, once people gets the opportunity you can see a different side of them, where they can be more confident, more outspoken and this only comes when they get the opportunity to lead

Initially I was not very confident of my photography skills but I learnt and improved through this journey, and Hui Ying asking me to teach made me feel empowered, that I can contribute to this place and help this place continue. I’ve never taught anyone how to take photos, and I hope it would be useful.

I was really not confident when I started, but while I was interning here I was asked to take up leading roles, and it made me more confident. And this carried over to university life, such as my project works. Similarly for communications, sometimes I’m wondering if I can communicate well enough to give people confidence in me to trust me to lead them, and I have became better at that.","While many other places have commercial nature programs, this is one place where you can freely explore nature and connect with yourself.

It’s activities are not coerced, but it is more collectivist in the sense that when someone wants to do something the person can initiate it and it will happen, like our previous BBQ. It’s a community that built up on it’s own, and i don’t know how it built up but a lot of people just wants to take part in it

7 : 7_GUI_FGD_Vols,"It taught me a lot of things, one of which is that the community here in GUI is very much “walk the talk”. The interactions here can be truthful to the values of graciousness, like saying hi, even to strangers. It’s inspired me to live more in accordance with these values, like saying hi to the bus captain when I board the bus. I’ve learnt to be more human, instead of relationships being transactional in nature

in GUI, when we eat lunch we don’t use disposables, and that’s when people really notice that “hey we can’t use a disposable”. And you have to really wash it afterwards.  That’s when it shifted my mindset, to bring a spork and tumbler. That translates to real action, compared to when it was just information in the past. So here it really made me walk the talk.
","In GUI here they are untamed and untouched, and it's very different from those that we are usually exposed to. And its equivalent to that of the rainforest, it makes you feel so much smaller, that nature is so much bigger. It gives you that groundedness and clarity to know that you are part of a much bigger landscape. I feel the rawness of the land, the stream when I walk here, and this me brings me back down, to feel grounded, and this is what i appreciate.

As evidenced by the soil, that GUI spent 2 years cultivating and getting healthy. It was a long arduous process, and a testament to how difficult it is for Singapore to have such natural state.

Like how that manifest physically, is like the mud bricks that is part of this building, some of them are produced by us.","It taught me that the way you interact with people and see things around you is not just as simple as getting things done. There are so many facets of people in your immediate society and being here allows me to interact with these people in a safe space. I understood better how to collaborate and work with people in society, and that there’s a much bigger picture out there","It’s very unstructured but yet some homogenity, its remarkable","It taught me that the way you interact with people and see things around you is not just as simple as getting things done. There are so many facets of people in your immediate society and being here allows me to interact with these people in a safe space. I understood better how to collaborate and work with people in society, and that there’s a much bigger picture out there

Nature does not hurry, but everything is accomplished. I think what GUI tries to say that there is psychological safety in learning, everyone has their own way/pace/time in learning and it doesn’t matter what you’re doing, but you shouldn’t be pressured to the norms of social life in Singapore.

This place accepts you for who you are and doesn’t judge your background. It’s really nice to be part of this community.

Here, there’s no hard commitment, and there’s a sense that you should only come only if you want to, to come and experience this space. That’s a feeling we have when we first came, and we took ownership of that. In the sense of community everyone played their part. And GUI’s key message is that everyone contributes to the community.","I’ve never seen a community here so devoid of personal interest, but just here working for nature.

So you feel a sense of ownership because you contribute to the space, and hence everyone feels part of the effort in building the community. Even though people come and go but every time you come back you still feel welcomed and its that psychological safety that you’ll still be welcomed even when you come back.

How this is done is to give them choice over things in their life, and in GUI that’s the sense that i can… your output can be seen directly, like if you till the land, you know that the effort that you put in has a certain output, and it gives you back that sense of control in life.

The community believes in a sense of agency. In GUI's and other community programs here, its really understanding the needs of the people before crafting out the program. It’s giving people the choice to do what they want before proceeding, unlike having a fixed program and asking if people want to join. So it gives people the agency to choose, to feel valued by the society
