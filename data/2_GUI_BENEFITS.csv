1 : 1_GUI_FGD_1_Core_1_,"I would want to empower my employees so they have the freedom to display in their own creativity how they want to serve the people that come to them. How they want to express how they want to make them more comfortable. So that is how I see empowerment.

If im the top management. So i would want to empower my staff to be able to do something on their own

So we try to include people in the decision making process.
","it brings them closer. They do something different? very raw, very natural. ? I think coming here and do all these things can give them that.
","Probably they have never had this kind of interaction at home i suppose… do something hands-on with your children or wives and stuff. So.. we’ve had, interacted with some of them they’re actually surprised that their child can do this

You do your thing i do my work, then suddenly, this connection, sudddenly. So i think this is beyond the skills part.. whether they know to do farm a plant, or whether they do, make a toy car or whatever or something. I think it’s hands on thing
","Just helping out with chores at home. I think we can actually make it fun, then just chores you have to do it. Just have to change the way you feel about doing the tasks. I think that helped changed, manifest in different people on different levels based on what is their personal experiences and then what actually translates to what’s applicable in their lives.
","
","you see these kids when they come back often they actually, are naturally more experienced in the wood working uh, process and techniques then they lead some of the friends who just came in recently. So you can see they are sharing .. on their own initiative.. Sharing with their peers. This is the kind of confidence and competency that they learn through the process.
","it brings them closer. They do something different? very raw, very natural. ? I think coming here and do all these things can give them that.

felt that the reason why we have attracted so many people is because Ground up initiative actually focuses a lot on environmental friendliness

so after the rain i’ll try not to step on the snails because after rain… open ? so cultivate some this kind of awareness this consciousness that they are not in our space we are in their space and we are sharing this space so..? Respect, appreciate.
","I think GUI is a space that, offers people a space, physical space but also a mental emotional space so that they can slow down. And they can, re-exam..?? i think is

Those who come here for healing like what we have mentioned just now and those who have returned again and again, erm, you can see that this group of people are willing to share with others what they have found in this space

Is it through nature then that the soul is healed here?

DTT (translated): I feel that it’s the people here. Erm yeah possible nature. Fifty fifty she says.
","I think there’s this element of trust give people power to try things you have to trust them first. I think that is what’s been assured through the process. It also takes a lot of courage ? and trust that they are not used to

i’m also in transition, and I’ve felt that the er, it’s safe to come  back here and yeah. Not only coming back to nature but like coming back to a family.

i felt that coming once or twice because i don’t come here regularly i felt that you need come here regularly to really feel that place. I felt that coming once or twice is more like for persona

And for building commmunity, there needs to be a giving part of it. Which is i want to give it back to the group. So previously i was more on the receiving and just taking. But if you want to build a community, the people who come back, they are ready to contribute back, or give back what they have received, yeah.

i think, a community is a place for the ?? relationships… i think, erm, this also relationship

But it is the people that bring out, and we stay connected. The thing is that we really stay connected and we keep in touch and we say hello when we go there and we go to visit one another too. So, that is a community that what singpore needs

Yeah beyond the campus. if we have a stationary place that would be awesome, because people know that there is a home to go back to.

this is a place where everyone can gather together and they can reach out to a bigger community with their ideas and thoughts and values. Yeah so this is needed.

Community for me is a mindset. But it’s a mindset that every individual, every different individuals holds different thought or idea of this community. So i think.. broader, broader sense that ? that kind of thing la. GUI whatever is here is well as she said is a place to go back when you get lost
"
2 : 2_GUI_FGD_2_Core_2,"we just give them that opportunity to, to do things. I think what we are trying to cultivate is that sense of ownership here. We believe that only when you own it, you will get to stay. And we want people to stay and go

I think it just means, er, even if you’re not hundred percent ready, people will be given the opportunity to be on that, in that role

empowerment in GUI's definition ? means that you're just given the opportunity to try even though you know there'll be mistakes. ah and it's ok. yeah but of course it has to be calculated la

Because empowerment means you follow up and close the work with the person.
","let's say our volunteers participate in programs, we highlight to them that for craftwork, we are using re/upcycled wood. And through that process we actually help in cutting down the uh, solid waste that's being incinerated and contributing to the environment and issues and so on. So, so, then they realise, then they can see the link that actually what they are doing is contributing to something that helps, yeah
","So actually I pick up some skills, and then I'm able to, you know, do a little bit of drilling here and there. So I think in that way it really helps me a lot also. So it's sort of like a handyman at home, yeah. And I'm able to also er, help my neighbours. My friends as well, I can give advice. 
","it’s really hard work, working in a farm. So from that sentence we think they can appreciate people who have been work hard to make sure that there’s food on the table. So there’s a sense of gratitude in that.

I think, the, it's that knowledge that we're trying to impart. So, really the soft skills that we're trying to influence people, that you feel the positivity here, you feel encouraged here.

And then this mindset can go back to other things outside of the GUI community. Then you learn how to cook at home better. 

it's what people bring back, not just only all these thing, it's like, like people bring back a mindset.

kind of mindset is to get you confidence. To bring, not skill, mindset back and confident back. 
","

So it's sort of like a handyman at home, yeah. And I'm able to also er, help my neighbours. My friends as well, I can give advice. 

The confidence. They can do things. By their own ways.

kind of mindset is to get you confidence. To bring, not skill, mindset back and confident back. 

It give me the courage to talk. So, this is the changes
","GUI can be that balance where urbanites can connect, come here, be comfortable, and yet be exposed at the same time. and because they are exposed slowly, they come to realise that hey actually there's this connection with nature that's important.

of course the environment there also, we have a lot animals here also. And, yeah it's a, it's like we are part of the, like we are already part of them. So, we plant together with them then, that gives some, like, something like, you won't feel it like, in some place where they control it

it's become a very big, like, very big uh, ecosystem for us and for them also, so we like, planting together, so, this gives us a different feeling la, compared to other places in Singapore

sometimes we'll see monkeys going around, then, then it's very fun, yeah. We're staying together with them, and yeah this gives a different feeling i think

we humans are also nature. Also inside nature. We're apart of nature. So people here are trying to create, oh sorry, trying to retain the space that more close to nature

So people come here to experience unperfection. 'Cause nature is just like that. So people come here, it looks close to nature, because they are wild. Here there're many things that grow wild. So, i think, that makes people difference
","I’m the farm team, so i think i work closer with people who come for farming, and things like that. Uh, most of the time they come because they say they just want to relax, don’t want to think much. And actually that half day it’s labour intensive but it’s also relaxing in, in some way.

many people they treat farming as a different ways so, some people they treat it as a, thing to, it's a stress reliever

that sense of purpose indirectly heal people who feel that, aiya, aimless in life

So to me I think, healing uh, is not only relaxing, not doing anything, but is a sense of purpose, knowing what they are doing. That's about it

So I think GUI gives that chance to review that state of mind

it gives a feeling that, there's no need to rush lor. And when you don't rush people. Because everyone's healing is different.

We have let people who took sabbatical to come here and volunteer. Yeah, of course going back to their workplace is still as challenging, but yeah, then having the chance to have at least be in touch, give us the chance to reengage lo

here it's like you spread the load. Then you let nature do its work lor. If finish the conversation you just sit there. Just breathe. I mean you can breathe elsewhere la. It's the people what.

Uh, sharing what they have, in terms of their skills or ability, uh, not, to gain er, monetary gains or acknowledgement or whatever ah, it's just for the pure fun of the enjoyment. Yeah. Then that creates a, it's very healing, it's a very healing process I think.

Sometimes when we see volunteers, you can sense that there's, something that's going on with this person. But we would not quickly rush over and how are you, can i help you, no we keep that space first, then we slowly sense and see who can have that capacity to maybe talk or at least point of communication. So we are not rushing to make things happen. And we believe that changes will come if you allow that to happen. 

Self-healing, rather than counselling, yeah, to help you overcome. But is, willing the resilience themselves, within themselves, to, to allowing time for you to heal yourself

Healing for me came in the form of physical health.

The youth that's leading Balik Kampung tomorrow, she is very out place because she just started work. Coming to GUI has helped her with that

She was here for a period of time and now she is back in the corporate world. Yeah. And doing well I think.

this, this place is not to retain people here. Is try to let people heal and go back to the society.

So there is no one kind of character that we only allow into to be here. And like I said there is no urgency of you having to heal.
","i think a good chunk of the whole kampung kampus is build by the community over the years, and uh definitely you see when someone um, have completed for example the er, mudbrick wall, something that is done by them, uh, they feel proud of it

Maybe it's like your home, erm it's like perfect imperfect?

I'm in a chat group 'cause I attended one myself and then they're like woah, upgrading their skill to other ?? like going to other places, 49:17 to learn other things, and then sharing hey I'm doing this and, it becomes like a community group lor. Yeah it's like a maker culture.

You're here, you feel like home. You're safe. Even if the programme is cancelled you can still do other stuff. Just like home.

But the frequency doesn't equate to depths. Er, sometimes people can really get it immediately, ??? I just feel so relaxed (laughter) that's it, one time is enough. They don't have to come back frequently, but they will know that there is a place I can go to

No, as long as you have been here, we saw you once, we spoke or doesn't, that doesn't really matter. Yeah. So everybody is GUI family (laughs) yes

It's just taking us for us to understand where does that connection starts. Where it's bringing us to

3 : 3_GUI_FGD_Young_26_below_Vols_12_Oct,"It makes me feel more confident, more empowered, to share what I feel is right because I find the community here that agrees with what I think is right. It’s not just me, it’s a lot of people who thinks this way and this is the right way to do things

I feel more emboldened to share them with people, even just small nuggets. This place has given me comfort to be really comfortable in my beliefs and my stand

previously I very rarely heard about someone say “oh yeah, you’re right”. So having this reaffirmation makes me believe in what I believe in.

I think being in a place like GUI, that empowerment comes from people who humanizes you in a dehumanized world. As long as we are a group of people who realize that we are on the ground, we are flat, we treat each other with respect and dignity, as autonomous individuals. This is the empowerment that this place gives

GUI does is that it gives a lot of ownership and empowerment to people to take their place and say that “oh I want to take care of this area” and that’s why we have active volunteers.

","This place is like, a good place to return to what I care for, and also to think about how every job can be changed in this

Gracious, Green, Giving, Grounded and Grateful. So all these values affected me, were things that I took away.

Being present in the moment.

Everyone dares to ask, do you need help? And if you need help, you will also dare to ask. It’s an open place and it’s very comfortable. That’s one of the biggest change. I feel more open now.

If I fail to mention something at the start of Balik Kampung, or at the start of my kampung tour then so be it. Just fail in knowledge and learn. The learning mindset also. Just treating every week is learning

I think mindset is important. I think GUI helps with that. Even though I can’t actually pinpoint a specific event, I think a more positive mindset and a more open mindset.

it makes me realize there’s more to it, a connection to myself, being closer to who I am rather than what the system wants me to be.

Adaptation. Just how things are so dynamic on the ground. People just have to constantly adapt and problem-solve.

Flexibility

","I think GUI made me a lot more self-aware.

I guess, in a place like this, it makes me realize there’s more to it, a connection to myself, being closer to who I am rather than what the system wants me to be.

Introspection. Self-care.

","But besides that, GUI has changed me personally in the sense that I’ve become more confident and I’m a lot more mindful right now. My interactions with people, my family


But besides that, GUI has changed me personally in the sense that I’ve become more confident and I’m a lot more mindful right now. My interactions with people, my family
","For me, it changed my diet. I had gone from a meat-based diet to now mostly plant-based diet. And my lifestyle practices, so over here, they are very mindful about the things we use, how things are ?? Sustainability ??

But after coming here, it’s really a hands-on experience. It really deepens my understanding of what this whole nature thing is about, how the ecosystem works, what are the insects or wildlife available, what can be the indicators to inform us of the cleanliness of the water, whether are the plants doing well or not. It becomes more of, apart from admiring the beauty, now I can be part of supporting this beauty to thrive. Be part of the beauty.

And we’re allowed to go anywhere. There’s a lot more connection back to the ground. And then, last time when we see ants we’re like “eww” but now it’s in the ground, it’s normal, it’s normal. Don’t go “eww”. Just don’t let it back.

after coming here, then getting to see the fruits of the labor, because I saw a cornfield grow from nothing then I was very amazed. I definitely feel more of a connection now.

Now when I look at the trees, I’m just like, thank you for the oxygen.

Other than nature connection, there was also connection with myself. Especially when there’s no volunteers that I have to care about, when I’m just there weeding, like those monotonous routine, doing the same action over and over again, it’s very quiet, it’s very nice. You can hear your own thoughts, like usually you’ll hear outside noise. But then when you’re weeding or farming, you think more about things like nature connection.

We don’t have to come specifically to GUI to experience nature, it’s just that when you’re in GUI, you’re more aware and conscious. There’s a deeper connection at GUI because we’re only thinking about one thing

But if you look at what nature is, it’s actually a combination of things that are very random, coming together and then bringing that synergy.

But after I come here, I realized that the connection to nature is a very personal thing. And how nature is like, I don’t think it can be simply explained by science

Nature is like a living classroom. Learning about myself, the world around us, or other people

But in this place, it’s a little bit different, because when you’re planting a plant, you’re giving a life to this certain organism. I think that’s something that I realize that nature could be nurturing. The environment itself could be nurturing, to allow for all these things to grow. There’s some sort of beauty to it.

I think for me, it’s mindfulness as well. Also to nature, to others and myself.

","I thought that GUI, it’s a place that allows me to be more aware about myself and just to develop some kind of introspection in my process of being very busy everyday, outside of this place.

craft is a medium that attracts people who are naturally introverted. That place gives you that sense of safety that you can plan to not come here to say you have some KPIs to fulfil, or you have some assignments to fulfil.

I used to work in a kitchen for 5 years. So that environment was harsh and being female in there doesn’t help. So I always thought that a lot of things was okay and that behaviour translates into everything I do. So that means you come to have overly high expectations placed upon yourself as well as people. You overwork, you think it’s okay. And even when I first started in GUI, I did that, not knowing that it’s actually wrong. And it’s a very weird place because everyone tells you to slow down

Other than nature connection, there was also connection with myself. Especially when there’s no volunteers that I have to care about, when I’m just there weeding, like those monotonous routine, doing the same action over and over again, it’s very quiet,

","If I wasn’t so close to the people here, I wouldn’t be coming back so often and so regularly.

I’m actually quite introverted, so it’s a very comfortable place to talk to people, connect to the community

when I was here, I felt like I was a part of, yeah. So that was a very big part of me.

I think what keeps me coming back is the people. So I’ve really grown to love the people here and it’s something that keeps me coming back

I feel that they genuinely welcome me and then somehow, over time by, myself also acquire that positive and negative and that..haa I don’t know, that just becomes so infectious.

My own interest is I really, genuinely could feel that they would love to interact with people, and somehow, I’m inspired to do likewise and take that up over time, and become more experienced.

Because as an intern ?? because in the face of nature, when you cannot control all the factors, everyone is equally small, so I think that allows a very stricter version of ourselves, when we are here, the volunteers, and they are forced to communicate on a lot of levels ?? So I think that helps to foster the community here

I think that’s from .. being down here for the first time. My first thought was that this community is really very different. I feel like it’s easier to assimilate, so from the beginning it was really a lot more ?? than other communities

So the sense of inclusion is cultivated by people of the core team, because the understand the human connection and the human relations.

So, you work alongside with them, and you know this are the spirits you have to embody in order to fulfil that human connection

I think it definitely grew over time. Continuity matters, so seeing a familiar face all the time when you come here, or seeing like a lot of familiar faces. That definitely gives you a sense of community because you actually know the person that you actually see right.

So I think that’s how the community is built here because a lot of people share similar values that they think certain things are important. I think that gives a kind of familiarity and sense of closeness in some ways

It’s through realizing and interacting on the ground that we are not very different, or rather, our differences can be reconciled. That’s why communities are very important, because communities allow people to help each other out, help them through their problems

It’s not very natural for me to immediately associate myself with a group for a first meeting, so probably it’s a period over time.

I didn’t come as often but I still felt part of the GUI community.

I think it’s also more of the culture, how they really .. you know how GUI really values the human interactions, human relations and they like..like Hui Ying, our core team member, checks up on me

they’ve seen so many volunteers come and go. That’s the beauty of it, because there’s a heritage to it. You only become part of the community when you understand the principles, and it’s only possible after some time, after more interactions

I think I learnt a few things. The power of community, that’s something I’ve learnt.

Introspection. Self-care. Community care

Positivity and community.

4 : 4_GUI_FGD_Vols_26_above,"But the bee stuff, systems, and engineering, these are the things that resonate with me. So that’s the part that empowers me to say, I’m tending to nature, I’m tending to all these interactions.

as children, what they experienced as teens will actually go on to shape their lives in very deep ways

Perhaps with all these opportunities to interact with the people, to contribute and all, then there should be some kind of healing that can perhaps help them be a bit more resilient.

But just noticing this in the natural setting. It becomes very healing and it builds that resilience, that I can do it. By just doing simple things, they feel that, I can do this. And then they slowly can do more, and they can change more. And they can change for the better, because they always have a choice. And you see in nature how little, ugly caterpillars can grow into butterflies

So trust, and intrinsic motivation is the next one I guess. It’s really something inside that drives you to do whatever that you’re doing and I think the people here, they really demonstrate that as well. And I think that alone gives you a lot of courage and a lot of power to do things

But just noticing this in the natural setting. It becomes very healing and it builds that resilience, that I can do it. By just doing simple things, they feel that, I can do this. And then they slowly can do more, and they can change more. And they can change for the better, because they always have a choice. And you see in nature how little, ugly caterpillars can grow into butterflies

So trust, and intrinsic motivation is the next one I guess. It’s really something inside that drives you to do whatever that you’re doing and I think the people here, they really demonstrate that as well. And I think that alone gives you a lot of courage and a lot of power to do things
","Here I learn from the real farmers, telling us, bees are used to pollinate orchards and stuff but they don’t feel safe, they feel stressed, because of that. The weeds that come in the flowers and the bushes, all of them give the leaves protection

the whole broader narrative of how our Earth is going down the inescapable path of climate change and global destruction

When I come here it’s like, oh the rambutan tree has rambutans now. There’s seasons. That’s a nicer feeling to that, and the durian tree still has durians, so it’s like oh so that’s how that works! And I appreciate it a lot better.

I guess it’s like understanding where the food we eat come from an all.

","I think relationships here, they are not exactly transactional. Like you say, talk about transaction, when you give something and you get something in return. But over here when we do things, and this is something that we have said across throughout this conversation, is that when we give, we don’t really expect anything in return. We do it because we actually want to contribute to the growth of this space. And that growth itself is the reward that we want, and being able to serve the people, that itself is good enough for us.

To not view people and relationships as a give and take situation but rather learning how to give because we actually want to do so. And we actually take pride in helping other people and seeing other people grow

I think it’s also building the intrinsic motivation to do something. So like how we’ve been saying freewill all that quite a lot but I think it’s really coming from the heart. So how do you nurture that want to give, want to do certain things, want to be gracious, rather than, I’m supposed to be, and this is how I would be judged.

I think it’s learning of attributes, of virtuous values, I’d say. That this place has. Because i think if you look back at the 5G values that GUI has, I’d think that actually what this space offers that cannot be offered in a formal school setting.

So it really is what people choose to see at the activity that they do. So I’d think that the answer is already there, just that it may not be that obvious. It’s the values that this place is trying to teach us.

I’d say learning what it is to feel, learning how to, as well as learning about experience, and learning to experience.

I’ve learned to become more grateful for whatever that I have

But really experiencing it throughout, like totally immerse yourself in the giving. So much so that you're overflowing with it that you want to give yourself and people would experience it, and they start creating that multiplying effect in the community.

But here, you come here you really walk the talk. Whatever values that you learned in school, but here you automatically would do it. Because somehow the space invites you to do it. And because people are really doing it. You just feel like, yeah it’s natural. Not because someone asked me to do it. It’s just natural, everybody just walk the talk.

For me it’ll be resisting against the narrative and entrenched norms of thinking, doing, and seeing the way things are. Making us rethink the way that we take things for granted.

","They were doing something about Earth, bringing people closer to nature, and how actually that can enrichen their lives in a built-up urban city

But the fact is that the stuff that you do here, you feel the connection because you have left your mark. And in the world there is all these curation, it’s very hard to leave your mark, and people want to be noticed

But the bee stuff, systems, and engineering, these are the things that resonate with me. So that’s the part that empowers me to say, I’m tending to nature, I’m tending to all these interactions.

It’s very connected. Because you see when you use your senses, not just your hands. Because when you touch the soil, there’s sensory and tactile. When you are planting a live vegetable, baby vegetable, it engages your whole being. And that experience is very intense.

So we actually have this environment where they actually get to sweat out in the hot sun, doing things they might not feel comfortable doing, at the. To begin with, like soil, earthworms. But then they slowly discover, hey it’s real, it’s not just in the textbook. So and then they come to their own realisation, then they do farm-to-table

So i would say that maybe there are certain sparks here and there that gave rise to certain practices that I do now. So I would say that it’s there. I would not consciously feel it, but I guess the fact that I don’t consciously feel it means its already natural process that came about very slowly, gradually. Something that I internalised. Something that is within me already.

You experience the greenery, yeah. How to be green, because they really ask to wash the dishes after you eat your lunch here. In a way you save the environment, save water, you really live or experience these values.

But here if you can express yourself, that’s the best way to heal. Cos you at acknowledged, your feelings get acknowledged. And in turn you get acknowledged.

And to the extent of healing it because this space is so inclusive, so embracing. There’s really no judgement, no right or wrong.

","It’s also the little surprises like, oh we have rambutans today! Oh, did you know the monkeys were destroying the beehives, plucking the durians. Oh, there’s a wasp nest and then everybody would come and take a look.

I think you’ll never know what’s going to happen here sometimes. I come here once a month, every time i come here something is different. There’s a new plant coming, there’s a new fruit, this tree is blossoming. The next time I come it’s flowering

Like, why we recycle? When we be green? It’s also because we are grateful for the things that we receive, from Earth, and also from our environment, our family

when they do the pallet, of course you just use the hammer and bang bang bang. That’s why it takes 5 minutes to assemble everything, and then take one hour to take out everything and try to reuse the pallet. So that is one of the realisation I have. I feel that it’s easy for me to realise that recycling is really not that easy.

when I first started, I was still using plastic bags and everything. But then you keep coming back and then all these positive influence starts to change your behaviour as well. So eventually i also carry my own totebags, and when I takeaway food I try not to take the plastic spoons, things like that.

Being aware that there’s nature, which we need and we need to keep it going. At the same time we live together with nature. We have all these fruit trees here not just for aesthetic purposes. We need them. They provide shade, they give us oxygen in the day, they provide fruits, home for the birds. Tons of functions for every single object here.

a vermicompost right, it might be like a plastic box in an apartment somewhere high up in a manmade building. It’s a connection to nature. From there you understand the worms, the decomposition. You know, it’s the biology and all that.

And maybe the recycling and the straws and the plastic, that is a real relationship with nature. Bad relationship with nature but it is our connection with nature. So it is part of it. I have this response when you talk about the Macritchie and stuff like that, I know you agree with me. But yeah this is our connection with nature, the urban people’s connection with nature.

And when people come in here and actually do the composting, and they plant the seeds, and they harvest the thing. They get to experience the whole cycle, of like, the food we eat actually goes back to earth, fertilise the food that we would eat the next time round

Even just now during lunch, one of the guys who was working on the farm said, hey don’t waste, don’t waste! You know just now we were working the farm, yeah don’t waste.

And there is no other place in Singapore that allows the people to actually experience the effects of all these climate issues, except for when you’re actually doing all these things yourself.

I think for me, it’s that people matters. So when you care about other people, then you care about the kind of environment that we are all collectively living in, and then we will try to care for that environment

okay. I decided to actually start talking to them and say Hi. And since then we have been talking and saying Hi, asking about their kids and stuff. So i think that’s like a big step for me also to do the initiation now. Now I can say I know everyone on the floor!

Which I think is still beneficial for getting people to know this space and also important for people to be in touch with nature and be in touch with the community.

you’re actually here for the purpose of contributing to something else other than yourself, this makes you feel happier, lighter, less pressure, more relaxed, and that’s what they say, healing the soul is.

So I really like the fluidity and everyone being very open and there’s not like a performance, there’s no grading, you’re not expected to… Yeah, that’s why I say it’s a good mental break.

There’s a process that happens and then you walk away, not healed, but you just walk away better.

this space kind of helped me to breathe better.

you’re actually here for the purpose of contributing to something else other than yourself, this makes you feel happier, lighter, less pressure, more relaxed, and that’s what they say, healing the soul is.

I think it’s more soul-nurturing instead of healing. Because i don’t think most people come here to heal, or come here broken. But more of like, you come here, and you grow.

it’s a growth-enhancing, you nurture your soul to be better, to be kinder, to be warm, to be more receptive of failures, to experience new things.
","So I got to know this place through a friend’s friend, so it was maybe around 2.5 years ago. So the first time I was here, it was like a very new experience because already on my first visit I remember like the community spirit here. So then I just like that feeling and being in a slightly more open space environment. So then I decided to start coming back more often on the weekdays

I think it’s like these breaks that allows you to come together and, you know, talk among the volunteers that kind of also helps to build up the so-called, community spirit over time. So I would say it’s like a one or two time thing. But if you happen to be here for a few times and if you are a part of this little bonding sessions, then I think it does help build up that community spirit thing.

It’s very much a community thing. Whether it's over a long period. The magic of this place, whether it’s you have a commitment of like yes I’m going to come here every single day because I I feel like so strongly about it, or you don't really care, maybe I come every once a year, you feel like welcomed, and it's not like a front that they put up to make you feel welcome. It’s just the philosophy and the principles

It’s a kind of place where it really is a community and the sense that it welcomes… it's a place that welcomes people. That's all that it needs to be. Let's use the analogy of a church maybe. You just come as you are. It is not a religion. You don't need to be anything. Just come and be part of it. That's all.

There is a lot of community spirit here. And the fact that everybody greets each other and give them a smile, really lightens up the day.

I’d like to touch on is the gotong royong spirit, which is very different from corporate culture of… community culture. People just willingly help each other out in different events because we are running a lot of different events out here. We have different groups, groups working at the farm, groups in woodwork, groups in the kitchen and all that, but we just collaborate without needing a lot of instructions from each other

word. Work together. I think it comes from those traditional village whereby they don’t talk about money. Like if you’re building extension of your house and you can’t do it alone. So your neighbours would just come by and help out.

It is a spirit of cooperation… helping others with need.

You’re not just taking care of something for yourself, for your own gain. Hereyou’re just working on a real community community plot. So at the end of the day you do the work, but in a sense you don’t do it for yourself, you just contribute and things that you gain back is different. Maybe friendship or new knowledge from fellow farmers, or woodworkers, that kind of thing.

Yeah, it’s a sense of belonging. And because you invested your time and energy into helping maintaining this space. So you feel in a sense you own a little bit of this

And we share this kind of weird stories among everyone else. Because it’s like, we are a community so something happened is everyone’s business.

I think the thing that makes me want to come back is actually the team, the people. Most would call it community or something.

I think it’s the people working together, making me coming back. Yeah so I find it’s quite meaningful to interact with one another as a team and maybe as a bigger community.

Which I think is still beneficial for getting people to know this space and also important for people to be in touch with nature and be in touch with the community.

I think for me, it’s that people matters. So when you care about other people, then you care about the kind of environment that we are all collectively living in, and then we will try to care for that environment

when everyone is living in harmony, then we can all feel peaceful and happy.

6 : 6_GUI_FGD_Vols_26_below,"I was lost after graduating from poly and was insecure about it. I had confidence issues in the past but things started to change since i came here. From “ i think i can do it” to “i’ll do it”, i try my best to do things.

I used to have doubts about my own ability to lead, but it helped me realise that i am able to do all these, to communicate what needs to be done and complete tasks.

Initially i was not very confident of my photography skills but i learnt and improved through this journey, and Hui Ying asking me to teach made me feel empowered, that I can contribute to this place and help this place continue. I’ve never taught anyone how to take photos, and I hope it would be useful.

I was really not confident when i started, but while i was interning here i was asked to take up leading roles, and it made me more confident. And this carried over to university life, such as my project works. Similarly for communciations, sometimes i’m wondering if i can communicate well enough to give people confidence in me to trust me to lead them, and i have became better at that.

","but here the involvement leads to greater understanding of how rich nature is. In here we give back to nature what we eat, and learn to take care of the land.

If i were to relate what we do here to the other environment, it would be that we can show the world that we can be sustainable by doing things like going plant-based, being conscious of my environment etc etc. And I am able to influence my friends to have better habits.

","I can learn so many things are so many people from all walks of life.

I realised that it’s not what its all about, that its important to connect with other people. I started to interact with more people, to hear and learn from their experiences. I think I lived a sheltered life but hearing their experiences give me a window to look into society, make me grow as a person. Learning from them makes me a more sympathethic person and opened up my ears to want to listen more and learn and grow from their experiences

I understand how many things here are deliberately and consciously designed. He explained to me how alot of things here are repurposed, like the furniture. Or how the kitchen is designed to make people be more aware of their water usage. It makes me feel like everything has a purpose and helps me see the little things in life

It also made me realise the importance of connecting with other people. After coming here I realise I’m more open to things.

I adopted the mindset of doing whatever you want and that everything will work out my way. I feel alot happier these days. Its the feeling of being free. I realise that the society’s model mindset can be quite toxic

Seeing this in real life, and people who actually convert these sustainable ideas to action is mind opening.

GUI helps us to learn soft skills, and lets us grow at our own pace without being afraid of growth.

It taught me how to be appreciative of things. Through this session i’ve been thinking about my interactions with people here, and it’s made me grateful that I’ve had these interactions, which is unlike what happens at work where we talk about work.

I really enjoy these short time i have here and i realise that you can make the best out of whatver time here, and this is also applicable to life.

To be grateful for what I have, even for the smallest things and not take them for granted.

I learnt from how Hui Ying interacts with the volunteer, how she makes an effort to takes notice of the small details and remembers you. This extra step can really make a difference to make you want to contribute to this place

","The environment here has made me more environmentally conscious about my personal habits, like the usage of straws. Also the stream was clogged up the other day, and I was really touched by how other volunteers were so emotionally connected to the land and affected by this episode.

All these little bits of human interaction with nature had made me more interested in nature, and I hope to have the time to connect with it physically soon.

While many other places have commercial nature programmes, this is one place where you can freely explore nature and connect with yourself.

","I realise that the “real” world is different, and it’s not so stressful to when I am here. And I am allowed to failed and make mistakes here, which is different from the outside world.

I feel like the air is much better than the exhaust in the city, and its helped to get my skin better.

I get tired from my internship, and I can come down here on the weekend to feel refresehed. My weeks are usually hectic and i have to churn out things, but this place gives me time to think about myself and not think about work

It’s a space where i can have my own quiet time, and here I am more conscious and reflective of myself. I hope to be able to energise myself here so that i can face the next week with more vigor

It’s good to come here to find new strangers and talk to them. It’s good to get away from all my problems, to get away from my project works and heal and forget about the problems.

In balik kampung we always have a meditation session where you take time to reflect on what you’ve done, and that has help me to reflect on what i’ve done the past week

Here i feel very free and i don’t have to think too much and just be present in the moment.

It’s heartwarming because when you come back there will always be someone you know, and it is welcoming

We form a community because we share similar beliefs in things that are important to use and we experience things that we are interested in together, which is different from other communities outside.

It’s activities are not coerced, but it is more collectivist in the sense that when someone wants to do something the person can initiate it and it will happen, like our previous BBQ.

That’s when it shifted my mindset, to bring a spork and tumblr. That translates to real action, compared to when it was just information in the past. So here it really made me walk the talk.

","It taught me that the way you interact with people and see things around you is not just as simple as getting things done. There are so many facets of people in your immediate society and being here allows me to interact with these people in a safe space. I understood better how to collaborate and work with people in society, and that theres a much bigger picture out there.

It taught me a lot of things, one of which is that the community here in GUI is very much “walk the talk”. The interactions here can be truthful to the values of graciousness, like saying hi, even to strangers.It’s inspired me to live more in accordance with these values, like saying hi to the bus captain when i board the bus. I’ve learnt to be more human, instead of relationships being transactional in nature

Here we have the “heartware”, it comes from the heart. We might have the same flora and fauna as other nature areas, but this is  where you have an active and loving community that give you opportunity to learn about this place.

Nature does not hurry, but everything is accomplished. I think what GUI tries to say os that there is psychological safety in learning, everyone has their own way/pace/time in learning and it doesn’t matter what you’re doing, but you shouldn’t be pressured to the norms of social life in singapore.

Besides activities, its more of the mindset. It helped us to embrace that there’s no perfect solution, which we get sucked in to find in the corporate world.

It’s small things that shifts our mindset. After I come here i don’t want to pursue materialism as much, like buying less clothes, bringing my own tumblr for drinks. And i encourage my colleagues to do so. Personally i just want to do what i can to pass on the teachings here.

The 5Gs of GUI.

That’s how the world progress, to collaborate and improve together, to continue the cycle of giving.

No one can be anxious here, and things takes its time and course here. I think its a mentality, teaches you something.

when we come here we are further reminded of what GUI believes in , like sustainability, and its also a concept that you believe in how it should be done.

","My spatial awareness have also be heightened, i used to move through my envrionment without being aware, but being here helps me be immersed in the space, to slow down and take notice of my sense

In GUI here they are untamed and untouched, and it's very different from those that we are usually exposed to . And its equivalent to that of the rainforest, it makes you feel so much smaller, that nature is so much bigger. It gives you that groundedness and clarity to know that you are part of a much bigger landscape. I feel the rawness of the land, the stream when I walk here, and this me brings me back down, to feel grounded, and this is what i appreciate.

the space allows people to feel the rawness of the place, but coupled with the people who are so warm here, its really the full combination.

","It’s the earthing kind of feeling that we need in this urban manmade landscape.

It feel like its not Singapore, where you can close yourself off to day to day work.

This kind of untouched place is needed, it helps you to accpet and respect nature. We don’t usually think too much of nature, but here is like a little reset button that helps you switch off.

Coming here the ideals give some sense of relief in terms of larger picture of life, the people you interact with, the instant sense of feeling of home here...there’s no expectations for you to contribute further than you want to. Getting down to the essence of human life

Compared to spending time here or time in say, a spa, the effect of GUI is longer, the feel good effect is longer. It’s a deep feel good that last a long time compared to a spa. This is spa for the soul.

It’s become like a home, and I'm really blown away by the community here. People here are so humble, gracious and accepting, and in spite of their diverse background.

the space allows people to feel the rawness of the place, but coupled with the people who are so warm here, its really the full combination.

So you feel a sense of ownership because you contribute to the space, and hence everyone feels part of the effort in building the community. Even though people come and go but everytime you come back you still feel welcomed and its that psychological safety that you’ll still be welcomed even when you come back.
