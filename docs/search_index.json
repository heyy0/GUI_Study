Relevant studies in the field have demonstrated a substantial reduction in stress levels and feelings of subjective restoration for individuals spending time in green spaces. The results of such studies led to the integration of urban policies that promote the preservation or incorporation of more greenery in cities. Nevertheless, a distinction between passive and active interaction with the green spaces has been posed since the effects on health and well-being might vary according to the strategy of development (i.e., top-down and bottom-up). In recognition of this distinction, this study was structured to investigate the sense of restoration and well-being enhanced by the active interaction of individuals with green spaces in what has been recognized as ‘place-making’ or direct engagement of individuals in the creation or preservation of the green space. To investigate this, the non-profit organization ‘the Ground-Up Initiative’ (GUI) in Singapore was selected as the main case study since this organization has for a decade conducted place-making activities that aim to enhance the connection of people with the natural environment. This study followed a sequential mixed-methods design, integrating: focus group discussion with GUI members and volunteers, perception survey with GUI members and the general public, and: quasi-experimental assessment on people attending GUI’s programs. The results indicated that different levels of restoration and subjective well-being could be achieved in place-making activities with the natural environment. The notions of empowerment and sense of community were identified as key factors in the place-making process that enhance feelings of subjective restoration and well-being. Ultimately, this study proposes a framework of dynamic interaction between natural environments and people through place-making in response to rapidly urbanizing environments. "]
